# GREYS Staff Portal — How it works

**Live:** https://staff.greyscheese.com  ·  **Manager console:** https://staff.greyscheese.com/manager.html (password `grey709`)

Three static pages, no app server (nothing to cold-start):

- **`index.html`** — the staff portal. View-only: notes & specials tiles, events, calendar, Memphis reservations, music. A "🔐 Manager" link opens the console. The **Schedule** tile opens `schedule.html` (the old Schedule and Request Off tiles were removed — schedule info lives on the calendar, and time-off requests live on the Schedule page).
- **`manager.html`** — the manager console. Password login, left sidebar menu, then clean record lists for Content / Schedules / Employees: readable rows with type & location badges, location filter chips (All / Memphis / Nashville / Franklin), and a proper edit window per item (each item carries its own location). Plus time-off approvals and the **Staff Scheduling** tab (all three weekly grids + print). CSV import lives under each list.
- **`schedule.html`** — the schedule view. The full weekly grid for the location is **public — no login needed**. An inline "See your own shifts" card lets staff type their **employee ID** (any text the manager put on their record — no password; internal tool) to unlock their own week (shifts, roles, hours, row highlighted in the grid) and a **Request time off** form (name auto-filled from their record) with their request history and statuses; approved time off shows as OFF badges.

## Staff scheduling

- **Roster:** Manager console → Staff Scheduling → Employees. Name, employee ID (the staff login — any text: number, initials, nickname; unique per location, matched case-insensitively), role, active/inactive. Per location. CSV import supported (`name, employee_id, role, active`).
- **Weekly grids:** the Staff Scheduling tab shows all three locations at once (shared week navigation), each with its own **🖨 Print** (opens a printer-friendly landscape sheet) and **⧉ Copy previous week** buttons. Click any cell to add a shift (start, end, role, note); click a shift chip to edit or delete. The editor's **Copy this shift to…** row duplicates it to any employee/day of the week. Week starts Monday.
- **Locations:** the console has no global location switch — each item carries its own location (filter chips per list). The manager console is desktop-first; the staff pages are phone-first.
- **Shared staff pool:** Nashville and Franklin share employees (`LOC_GROUPS` in manager.html and schedule.html). Both manager grids show the combined roster; a shift belongs to the grid it's added on. Staff at either site see shifts from both, tagged NSH/FRK, and their time-off requests count across both sites. Memphis is separate.
- **Time off:** approved requests (Time Off tab) automatically show as red **OFF** badges on both the manager grid and schedule.html, matched by employee **name** (case-insensitive) — keep roster names identical to the names staff use on the request form. The shift editor warns if you schedule someone on an approved off day.
- **Employee login:** schedule.html looks the typed ID up in `portal_employees.login_id` (active only) — no password, no signup. Remembered in the browser; "Not you?" switches user.

## Hosting

- Repo: **`github.com/brad695/staff-portal`** → Render **Static Site** `greys-staff-portal` (publish dir `.`, auto-deploys on commit). To update the live site, commit/upload the changed file to the repo.
- Custom domain `staff.greyscheese.com` is registered on `greys-staff-portal` (CNAME → `greys-staff-portal.onrender.com`).

## Data (Supabase, project `vdvtrevhqalmjwhjhjug`)

Pages read directly via the publishable key; all writes go through the **`portal-api` Edge Function** (password-checked server-side).

- **`portal_items`** — unified content. Columns: `type` (note/special/event), `title`, `body`, `date`, `time`, `end_date`, `repeat` (none/weekly/biweekly/monthly), `repeat_until`. Notes need only a title; specials/events need a date.
- **`portal_schedules`** — schedule entries (`name, date, end_date, note`).
- **`portal_time_off`** — staff time-off requests (public insert; approvals via the function).
- **`portal_employees`** — scheduling roster (`name, login_id, role, location, active`). `login_id` is the free-text employee ID, unique per location; used as the passwordless staff login on schedule.html.
- **`portal_shifts`** — individual shifts (`employee_id → portal_employees, date, start_time, end_time, role, note, location`). Deleting an employee cascades to their shifts. Function actions: `add/update/delete-employee`, `bulk-add-employees`, `add/update/delete-shift`, `bulk-add-shifts`, `copy-week`.

**Recurrence:** set `repeat` + `repeat_until` on a special or event and it expands automatically on the staff page and calendar (e.g. a weekly Tuesday special shows every Tuesday until the end date).

**CSV columns** — Content: `type, title, date, time, end_date, repeat, repeat_until, details`. Schedules: `name, date, end_date, note`. Dates `YYYY-MM-DD`, times `HH:MM` (24h) or blank.

## Reservations (Wix)

The Reservations/Resys tab and the calendar pull from Wix Table Reservations via the Edge Function, **filtered to the Memphis location only** (`WIX_LOCATION_ID`, default hard-coded to Memphis). On the calendar each reservation shows as its own tile (time · name · party size); cancelled/declined/no-shows are hidden.

## Edge Function secrets

Set in Supabase → Edge Functions → Secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NOTES_PASS` | manager password (currently `grey709`) |
| `WIX_API_KEY` | Wix API key |
| `WIX_SITE_ID` | Wix site ID |
| `WIX_LOCATION_ID` | (optional) Wix reservation location to show; defaults to Memphis |

`SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are injected automatically.

## Notes / follow-ups

- **Edit protection:** the manager password is verified inside the Edge Function, so it never ships in the page. Reads are open to anyone with the URL (internal staff tool).
- **Legacy files:** `server.js` and `notes.json` are the old Node app and are no longer used (the live site serves only `index.html` + `manager.html`). Left in place for reference.
- **Security advisory (tickets side, unrelated):** the `holds` table has Row Level Security **disabled** — anyone with the anon key can read/write it. To lock down: `ALTER TABLE public.holds ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;` plus policies.
